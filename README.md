Steam recommendations
This script was written for the Tampermonkey browser extension.
Its task is to fetch the number of viewed Steam recommendations.
It requires the SteamDB extension. After installing it, you have to go to the page "https://store.steampowered.com/explore/", refresh it and then in the bottom left corner there will be a red button, clicking on which the script will run.
